# Exercise 1 (open1):
Write a Python program that opens a file called "sample.txt" and prints its contents.

# Exercise 2 (open2):
Write a Python program that opens a file called "numbers.txt", reads two integers from the file, and prints their sum.
Assume that the file "numbers.txt" contains two integers separated by a space, e.g., "10 20". (edited) 

# Exercise 3 (write 1):
Write a Python program that creates a new file called "output.txt" and writes the numbers 1 to 10, each on a new line.

# Exercise 4 (read and write):
Write a Python program that reads the content of a file called "input.txt" and writes the reversed content to a new file called "reversed.txt".

# Bonus (json):
Write a Python program that reads a JSON file called "data.json" and converts its contents into a dictionary.
The "data.json" file contains information about employees in a company.
Each employee has a name, age, and department.
data.json:
{
    "employees": [
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "age": 30,
            "department": "Engineering"
        },
        {
            "name": "Jane Smith",
            "age": 25,
            "department": "Marketing"
        },
        {
            "name": "Mike Johnson",
            "age": 35,
            "department": "Sales"
        }
    ]
}
Hint:
research about json
research the json module
